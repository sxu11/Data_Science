Monetary: 
- Fed: "Very supportive m2 growth": M2 is a measure of the U.S. money stock that includes M1 (currency and coins held by the non-bank public, 
checkable deposits, and travelers' checks) plus savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts), 
small time deposits under $100,000, and shares in retail money market mutual funds.
  - Powell focuses on:
    - Full employment
    - Inflation > 2% (right now we are 1.5%~2%)
  - Fed won't tighten, though market itself maybe
  
- Other indicators that perhaps calls for tightening monetary policy:
  - Commodity price moves up rapidly
    - esp Copper, and Copper/Gold
      - Copper is the commodity w/ PhD (because its rising prices sometimes precede periods of economic growth)
      - Gold is save haven (避风港) or inflation hedge 
    - this trend suggests:
      - animal spirits out there
  - Dollar goes down
  - Housing prices up at double-digit rate
  - Crypto currency 

- Market leads the Fed

Fiscal Policy:
- Budget reconciliation 1.7~1.9 trillion $
  - not include $15 min wage 
    - may be in 3~4 trillion $ infra bill (on the way)
  - We will pay for this, by growth
  - Other investors are worried
- 600 billion stimulus already going on (personal income report) from Dec 2020
  - Disposable personal income up 11.5% month-to-month
  - Spending: up 2.4% month-to-month
  - Saving rate: 20.5% (gone down from peak of crisis: 35%, though we though it would go to single digit)
Conclusion: these indicators say economy on fire, have high multipliers: 
  - (a $ spent causes more $$ to be spent) 
  - e.g. in housing, including other purchases w/ house
  - capital spending: really strong, digital everything, innovations
  - this week, higher valuation part of equity market:
    - Long rates up to 1.6% on 10-year treasury bond yield
      - Many bond investors thought at beginning of year < 1% 
      - record shorts placed on bond market (they are playing the momentum here)
        - interest rate goes up
        - price goes down (TODO?)
      - Thus, rate going up paused (too much bearishness out there)
