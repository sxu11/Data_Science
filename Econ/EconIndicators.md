Monetary: 
- Fed: "Very supportive m2 growth": M2 is a measure of the U.S. money stock that includes M1 (currency and coins held by the non-bank public, 
checkable deposits, and travelers' checks) plus savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts), 
small time deposits under $100,000, and shares in retail money market mutual funds.
  - Powell focuses on:
    - Full employment
    - Inflation > 2% (right now we are 1.5%~2%)
  - Fed won't tighten, though market itself maybe
  
- Other indicators that perhaps calls for tightening monetary policy:
  - Commodity price moves up rapidly
    - esp Copper, and Copper/Gold
      - Copper is the commodity w/ PhD (because its rising prices sometimes precede periods of economic growth)
      - Gold is save haven (避风港) or inflation hedge 
    - this trend suggests:
      - animal spirits out there
  - Dollar goes down
  - Housing prices up at double-digit rate
  - Crypto currency 

- Market leads the Fed

Fiscal Policy:
- Budget reconciliation 1.7~1.9 trillion $
  - not include $15 min wage 
    - may be in 3~4 trillion $ infra bill (on the way)
  - We will pay for this, by growth
  - Other investors are worried
- 600 billion stimulus already going on (personal income report) from Dec 2020
  - Disposable personal income up 11.5% month-to-month
  - Spending: up 2.4% month-to-month
  - Saving rate: 20.5% (gone down from peak of crisis: 35%, though we though it would go to single digit)
Conclusion: these indicators say economy on fire, have high multipliers: 
  - (a $ spent causes more $$ to be spent) 
  - e.g. in housing, including other purchases w/ house
  - capital spending: really strong, digital everything, innovations
  - this week, higher valuation part of equity market:
    - Long rates up to 1.6% on 10-year treasury bond yield
      - Many bond investors thought at beginning of year < 1% 
      - record shorts placed on bond market (they are playing the momentum here)
        - interest rate goes up
        - price goes down (TODO?)
      - Thus, rate going up paused (too much bearishness out there)
    - the bond rate raises from the crisis 0.5%, which volatility > equity market
      - reason: bonds have been in bubble, search for yield becomes extreme
    - 2-year, 5-year (belly of the curve) interest rates also go up
      - they were held down, as Fed said "we're not going anywhere"
        - could signals "market leads the Fed", means "economy is so strong, market doesn't need QE"
          - on 2016-2017, QE is on its way out and Fed was going to raise IR, market was nervous
            - Trump won the election, worries that odds of cyclical burst up as him promised to cut tax
            - But meanwhile, value stocks TOOK OFF! (just like now)
          - YTD (year to date), energy stocks up 27%, financial 11%, tech 1%, health down
            - traditional (value) stocks caught up (w/ growth strategies)! We feel good!)
            - bull market broadens out, good
              - during tech & telecom bubble, we know how that ended..
              - tech innovations were not ready, though seeds planted
              - I like the fear recently (that won't last), reality check
          - after market broadened out on 2016 end, 2017 was fantastic for equity market; I believe we are same now
Worries:
- Treasury secretary Janet Yellen gone out of her way (why?), say bitcoin: 
  - speculative (yes, up 5 fold is extreme, and recent buyers influenced by other people w/o real understanding)
  - not environmentally friendly/sustainable (yasin almandra's whitepaper on mining, arc-invest.com)
    - compare energy (hydroelectric and other renewables) use w/ mining gold, it's a fraction of it
    - much more rapid settlement (10 min) than traditional financial institution (few days)
    - we saw trillions of $$$ in use cases; we as investors need to be supportive; it is the most secure blockchain tech
      - think about million transactions in 10 min, very secure; cost as $10
  - help illicit/criminal activity
    - FBI agent: best thing ever. FBI filed with cryptographers who uses transparent by IP address
  - Why? She doesn't understand it

- Impact of interest rate on PE ratio
  - (share)Price-to-(share)earning ratio
    - That's why high multiple stocks have been hit hard
  - Puzzle for Cathy in last 10~20 years:
    - as 10-year treasury interest rate falls, during tech telecom bubble, from 6~7%, to 0.5% in corona
    - PE ratio, which should have gone up (because of the discounting of future cash flows), seems always tops out in the 20~25. 
      - it's an earnings yield, if you do e/p, get 4~5%
    - This tells us: equity market has never incorporated 1~3% into the valuation structure of the market
    - if we are right, the nominal growth in the economy is not going to be 4~5% (normalized rate that the market has been baking in)
    - what if the normalized growth rate is actually 2~3%
      - rapid grow company should do calc seriously! 
        - no one will believe me, unless tested!
      - we believe: 10-year treasury yield needs to move that 3% and maybe fail
        - nominal growth of econ should be 2~3%
          - Why: we think there are deflationary forces evolving in global econ
            - fighting this notion that monetary QE will ignite inflation
            
            - dueling match the 2 deflationary forces
              - 1 is good deflation: tech-enabled innovation
                - deflation by nature
                - rides down cost curves, gains efficiency/productivity
                - e.g. for EV (robotics), 
                  - it is 28% for every cumulative doubling in the num of units produced. 
                  - We're at 2.2 million units of EVs right now; will move to 40 million in next 5 yrs
                - e.g. for DNA sequencing
                  - it is 40%, we are at low base now
                - e.g. for energy
                - e.g. for AI
                - e.g. for blockchain
                - these disruptive innovation will cause creative destruction in traditional world
                   - investors haven't appreciated how these S-curves are feeding one another/combinatorial/multiplicative
                   - these innovations will CONVERGE! e.g.:
                     - autonomous taxi networks: robots, energy storage, AI
                - Will take a while to see this in economic stats, which are 
                  - so grounded in industrial world
                  - don't capture much in digital world (but they will)
              - 1 is bad deflation: disruption to tradition order:
                - put a lot of companies at risk, thought they are steady at ease:
                  - financial svc sector
                  - auto, rail sector
                    - any company/suppliers around w/ internal combustion engine
                  - shareholders short-sighted, they cater them by consistently
                    - leveraged up to buy back their shares (TODO) and pay dividends
                    - we've seen results in blue-chip stocks: GE, IBM
                    - their horizon aren't 5~10 years, but 2 years or CEO's term
                  - We predict they will:
                    - cut their prices in order to service their debt (TODO)
                - Ray Dalio, Jeff Gundlach, Howard Marks have focused investors on
            
            - Money, inflation? Will be a lot of confusion
              - velocity (turns over) of money will continue to fall
                - Reason that QE after 08-09 meltdown never ignited inflation (even though Money went up): 
                  - turn over rate per year (velocity) slowed down as people risk-averse 
                  
Liquidity in ETF space broadly
- We manage assets in many different wrappers
- misunderstanding of liquidity in ETF: 
  - going back to 08/09, many active bond strategies in ETF wrappers
  - investors fear, wanted to get their money out of bond funds
  - only liquidity provide then (in ETF space): 
    - market makers
    - authorized participants
  - the underlying bonds were not trading! 
    - market not working
    - ETFs were out there & provided a market 
      - did they take a discount? yes (and should have), the price of liquidity at that time
  - even though equity market volatile/volume exploded, the ETF industry handled it beautifully!
  - as a portfolio manager, I know the diff between:
    - ETF wrapper (no worry of flows); just making investment decisions
    - mutual fund wrapper (need worry, if market shut down)
