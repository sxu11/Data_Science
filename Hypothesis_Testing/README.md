Hypothesis Testing in Health

Q1. What type of data do I have?
 - Categorical (Mortality rate: death/survival, Compliance with discharge
 instructions: yes/no)
    - Testing proportions
 
 - Numerical (Temperature, Pain scale, Num of visits)
    - Testing mean
    - Testing correlation/regression
    
Q2. How many samples do I have?
- One sample
- 2 samples
- 2-ish samples
    - One sample, 2 measurements (before and after weights w/ a diet,
    BMI and Systolic Blood Pressure)
    - Two samples with natural pairing (mothers and their babies)
- More than 3 samples


Q3. What is the test supposed to do?
- Compare the data
- Seek a relationship ("risk factor"..)

F test:
- The 𝐹 is the ratio of two variances (𝑆𝑆𝑅/𝑆𝑆𝐸), the variance explained by the parameters in the model 
(sum of squares of regression, SSR) and the residual or unexplained variance (sum of squares of error, SSE).

- The F-test of overall significance indicates whether your linear regression model provides a better fit to the 
data than a model that contains no independent variables.

- An F-test is a type of statistical test that is very flexible. You can use them in a wide variety of settings. 
F-tests can evaluate multiple model terms simultaneously, which allows them to compare the fits of different 
linear models. In contrast, t-tests can evaluate just one term at a time.

    - The null hypothesis states that the model with no independent variables fits the data as well as your model.
    - The alternative hypothesis says that your model fits the data better than the intercept-only model.

- To use the F-test to determine whether group means are equal, 
    it’s just a matter of including the correct variances in the ratio. 
    In one-way ANOVA, the F-statistic is this ratio:
    - F = variation between sample means / variation within the samples
    
- Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, 
since the two-group case can be covered by a t-test (Gosset, 1908). - from wiki
    - When there are only two means to compare, the t-test and the F-test are equivalent; 
    the relation between ANOVA and t is given by F = t2.
