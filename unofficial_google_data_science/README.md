November 19, 2015

http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/2015/11/how-to-get-job-at-google-as-data.html

(1) Know your stats. 

At least 3 or 4 courses in probability, statistics, or machine learning
stats.stackexchange.com

(2) Get real-world experience.

Collecting your own data, cleaning it, sanity-checking it, and making use of it.

Write a script to pull data from one of Google’s public APIs and write a blog post about what you’ve found.

Use a web scraper to scrape a few hundred thousand web pages and fit some topic models to create a news recommendation engine. 

Write an app for your phone that tracks your usage and analyze that. 

Be creative!

(3) Spend time coding.

scripting languages like Python and SQL

numerical languages like R, Julia, Matlab, or Mathematica

Bonus points for knowing a compiled language like C++ or Java.

(4) Be passionate.

your talent skews toward the engineering side, you may want to pursue the standard software engineer track and ask for a more analytical role — 

if it skews towards numbers, you may want to pursue the quantitative analyst track.

there are other jobs calling for data scientists in Sales Ops, Marketing and People Ops.

Our quest for robust time series forecasting at scale 
April 17, 2017

CausalImpact is powered by bsts (“Bayesian Structural Time Series”), also from Google, 
which is a time series regression framework using dynamic linear models fit using Markov 
chain Monte Carlo techniques. The regression-based bsts framework can handle predictor 
variables, in contrast to our approach. Facebook in a recent blog post unveiled Prophet, 
which is also a regression-based forecasting tool. But like our approach, Prophet aims 
to be an automatic, robust forecasting tool.


Cleaning Adjustments

We also permit transformations, such as a Box-Cox transformation.
